h2.  tobLog -- a thinboject-driven blog?

This is completely experimental, or not even that -- barely a vague 
idea.  I'm working on this system which I call thinobject, a few 
conventions and simple procedures to implement fully object oriented
systems on a filesystem, using ordinary executables.

But see http://kirv.github.com/thinobject for that.  Here I want to 
explore using this scheme in some useful. way.



h2.  how might it work?

No idea, really, but imagine, if you will, that we have a class -- a 
collection of methods and attributes with some kind of cohesive goal, 
perhaps -- call TobLog.  We could then create a toblog object:

    @$ tob-new testblog TobLog@
